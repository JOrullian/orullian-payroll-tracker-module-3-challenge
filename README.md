## Description
This site is designed to be a simple-to-use employee salary tracker. Upon opening the page, the user will be greeted with a blank employee roster and a blue "Add Employees" button at the bottom. When the button is clicked, a series of windows prompts will allow the user to input employees first names, last names and salaries, a single employee at a time. After inputting employee data, a data table will be populated with the inputs with the data being sorted top to bottom alphabetically by the employees last names. Additionally, the console can be opened to view average salary and a random employee drawing. The "Add Employees" button can be pressed after canceling out of the process to add more employee data and rerun the average salary and random drawing features of the page.

As I built this page, I learned that the purpose of 'return' is to give you an output to use further down your code. For example, the page required me to return the array of employees after adding data to it so that the filled out employee array could be used to calculate the average salary and obtain a random employee drawing winner.  A second lesson I leared from coding this page was the proper way to write an array of objects. I struggled to get my functions to run properly until I created my array and had a function that fed data into the array in the form of multiple parameters (firstName, lastName, and salary).
